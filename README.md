# ioiometer-pc

The original Android version is [here](https://github.com/jrieke/ioiometer). The PC version comes as a jar (see `dist/IOIOMeter.jar`). It does neither contain all features of the app nor does it look as pretty. 

A big thank you goes to Per Hellstr√∂m for reconstructing this code from the jar file (and making up for my foolishness of deleting the code without a backup).
